It is an interesting pattern where people consider their tax refund as a "bonus" or "free money". 
It has the same psychological effect as returning goods and feeling that you earned that money, a mentality that is detrimental to your financials.

As advisors, we have the responsibility of making sure that our clients make financial choices that are appropriate with their wealth surface(?) and tax refunds are money that can help them achieve their financial goals faster. 

Today, we are going to explore a strategy that we are using at Overlay, in order to present the benefits of using a tax refund to boost your portfolio.

The best strategies regarding investments are the ones that require little to no interaction with customers: setting up their tax refunds to go directly to their investment account is one of them.

If the client wants us to invest that money, we can go to  [Overlay -> Settings](https://overlay.agentrisk.com/inbox), add Cash to the portfolio and then setup the rebalancing to distribute the money as you see fit. 

The orders will be automatically generated and after we execute them, the email to be sent to the customer will also be ready.
